One should be careful withh GetInstance() method if 
dealing withmultithredding. May be you should introduce locks or smth..

If our singleton is always used and creating of the instance doesnt take 
critical amount of time one can preinitialize singleton like

private static Singleton singleton = new Singleton();
If so, GetInstance method returns the instance without null check.
